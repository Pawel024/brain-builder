## Want to learn more? 

Here are some videos and websites we found very helpful when learning about neural networks:

- Amazing video series (we're serious, please watch this): ["The Basics of Neural Networks, and the Math Behind How They Learn"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks) by 3blue1brown
- Pretty visualisations: ["Why Neural Networks Can Learn Almost Anything"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QczhVg5HaI) by Emergent Garden
- Even prettier visualizations: ["Watching Neural Networks Learn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwXa7Cvfr8) by Emergent Garden
- A more advanced version of this tool, made by Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter (these people work at Google, so they know what they're doing): [https://playground.tensorflow.org](https://playground.tensorflow.org)
- A great website if you're looking for answers to your data science related questions: [https://towardsdatascience.com/](https://towardsdatascience.com/)

## Want to start coding?
- A nice tutorial if you want to code your own nn without fancy libraries (this is how this app started!): [https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/](https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/)
- A nice tutorial if you do want to learn the fancy libraries: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-neural-network-with-pytorch/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-neural-network-with-pytorch/)
- Official pytorch tutorial (the library we used to train the neural networks): [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
- Documentation of a widely-used machine learning library (we used it to create some of the datasets, but they also have a neural network module): [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

Enjoy learning!
